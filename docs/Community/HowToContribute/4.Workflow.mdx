## Workflow

### Jira workflow

- To do - ready to be worked on
- In progress - actively working on it
- Code review - there's a merge request for it and other devs are reviewing the code
- To release - merge request was accepted and merged into the master branch
- Done - implementation has been released

### DoR - Definition of Ready

Let's define what is necessary to start a task:

- Clear and understandable acceptance criteria
- Task is estimated (if applicable)
- Task has no blockers

**Before start let's review requirements, just as a part of backlog grooming on our [weekly meeting](https://confluence.8x8.com:8443/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=10685279)**

### DoD - Definition of done

Let's define when we can clearly say - **WELL DONE!**

- Has a right file structure - based on standards
- Contains necessary files - based on standards
- ~90% UT coverage
- If not - create a ticket for it
- Zero warnings on linter
- Code review is done
- All the acceptance criteria are resolved
- CHANGELOG.md file is updated
- README.md file is updated
- Component is accepted by Design Team
- Does what is supposed to do
