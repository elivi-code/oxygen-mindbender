## Set up Oxygen on your computer

If it's your first touch with Oxygen,
don't worry in a few steps you can **set up the project** locally and **start coding**, however, if it's your very first time
in a front-end ecosystem, we recommend spending some time on [tools](?path=/story/quick-start-04-requirements--page)
which we use in Oxygen.

Before you start, please ask yourself the following questions:

- Am I familiar with the Oxygen [code of conduct](?path=/story/community-code-of-conduct-communication--page)?
- Do I want to follow the [code standards](?path=/story/community-guidelines-accessibility--page)?
- Do I have the right access for fetching and pushing code base to Oxygen?

Please follow those steps to bring to life Oxygen on your computer:

## 1. First-Time preparation

** 1.1 Clone repository**

```
git clone git@github.com:8x8/oxygen.git oxygen
```

** 1.2 Install the latest [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)**

We recommend using [Homebrew](https://docs.brew.sh/Installation) to install yarn, however you can choose whatever which you are familiar with:

```
brew install yarn
```

## 2.Run project

Once you have all global tools up and running, it's time to install all project's dependencies

**2.1 Install dependencies**

In the cloned repository directory( by default `oxygen`) install dependencies by:

```
yarn
```

**2.2 Set internal package symlinks**

```
yarn bootstrap
```

**2.3 Build the dev version of the project**

Keeping this process running, it updates the `/dist` directory of each package

```
yarn build:dev
```

**2.4 Start a local [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) server**

```
yarn storybook
```

At the end of the installation, you should be able to see the Oxygen storybook in your browser, by default on (`http://localhost:9000/`)

** ðŸŽ‰ CONGRATS ðŸŽ‰ Now you can contribute to the Oxygen library**
