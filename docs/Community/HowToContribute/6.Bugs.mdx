## Working with bugs

<br />

### I found a bug, what's next?

- Go to the [Jira board](https://agile.8x8.com/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?projectKey=OX&rapidView=416&view=planning) and create a new bug task
- Describe the issue, with as many details as possible

If it's a major/blocking issue, you can go into **8x8 - Oxygen TECHNICAL** room and talk about it there and someone will pick it up and work on it ASAP.

If you are a developer, feel free to fix and open a merge request :)
