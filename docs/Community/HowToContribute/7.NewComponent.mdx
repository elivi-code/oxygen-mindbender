## Create new component

<br />

### I have an idea for a new component, what's next?

- Firstly please double check, there is a chance someone has created that one or quite similar
- YES, Oxygen includes that one, and moreover it meets my expectations. SUCCESS, you can easily use it in your project.
- NO, there is no component what I need, let's move to step 2,
- YES it exists in Oxygen, however, I need something more, and I need to add a new feature.
- Check out how to add new features.
- I'm absolutely sure in the Oxygen library there is no component which I need.
- Create a new epic in the Oxygen project on Jira. The name of the new epic should be compatible with below standard: OX - ComponentName
- Create a Story in a proper epic. It might be like that: ComponentName - Create API requirements
- Create a Story in a proper epic. It might be like that: ComponentName - Implementation
- Create a Story in a proper epic. It might be like that: ComponentName - UAT
- **HAVE FUN!**
