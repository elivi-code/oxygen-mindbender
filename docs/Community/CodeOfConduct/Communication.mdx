<Meta title="Community/Code Of Conduct/Communication" />

## Communication

Work is our second home, each of us builds the Oxygen community and atmosphere around it. In our home, we want to
feel comfortable and accepted, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression,
level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

This is how we build a friendly work environment:

- using welcoming language,
- being **respectful** of differing viewpoints and experiences, especially on Code Review,
- accepting **constructive** criticism,
- showing **empathy** towards other community members

## Do the following things, to build a friendly community

- Avoid "easy" and "simple", someone can have a bad day, or be on a different level of understanding.
  Instead, try to explain your point of view in steps
- Avoid slang, and metaphors - we all love inside jokes and jargon, however, it might be hard to understand to someone new in the community,
- Define jargon - sometimes it is hard to not use jargon, then elaborate it in few more words,
- Abbreviate terms - In the IT world we have loads of abbreviations, it's hard to not use them, however,
  be sure everyone understands them. When writing the documentation, you can explain abbreviated terms at the very beginning.
