# Changelog

The main reason to keep a Changelog is for downstream consumers of Oxygen packages.
When integrators upgrade to a new version of Oxygen, they want to know what has changed so that they can apply any relevant changes to their codebases.
It also informs people on potentially holding off certain upgrades if they have a significant impact on their project.

The Changelog is based on https://common-changelog.org/

## Structure

Each package has its own `CHANGELOG.md` file, located in the root of the package.
The root `CHANGELOG.md` file is generated automatically by the release script and it pulls in all items from each package's individual changelog.

### Changelog Item

Each changelog item _must_ be a a single line, and it _must_ be a markdown list item (start with a `-`).
We don't supported nested lists, so if you have a list of items, they should be separate entries.

## Categories

We use the following categories (keep them in this order):

- `Changed` for changes in existing functionality
- `Added` for new functionality
- `Removed` for removed functionality
- `Fixed` for bug fixes.

After each category list each (conceptual) change and mention the Jira ticket in braces at the end.

Example:

```md
## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Simplify Icon Tooltip rendering (removed local state) (OX-620)

### Added

- Add `Tooltip` prop `offset` (OX-620)
```

**Important:** All entries need to be added under the `Unreleased` section.

If the category is already listed, simply add your item to the list.
