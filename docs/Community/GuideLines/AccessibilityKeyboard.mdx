## Keyboard accessibility

Keep in mind, not only power users and developers love using the keyboard to navigate around the application.
See what we can do to improve our productivity:

- Do **not remove** default browser **outline** style. We all know it is awful but helpful. Ask your designer for an alternative way to show the user when an element is focused.
- Support _forwardRef_ in components
- Support _Tab_, _Shift+Tab_, _Spacebar_, _Enter_
- Care for proper tab ordering
- Make sure no function on your website requires timed keystrokes â€“ such as double tap enter/return within two seconds to submit

### How to audit

<hr />

The best way is to **test it manually**, put aside the mouse and try to use your application/components only by the keyboard.
If you lost somewhere focus or get into a trap, please consider - how to fix it.
