## Accessibility

The major principle: **THINK AS A USER NOT AS DEVELOPER!**

The first principle should be enough, however, web accessibility is an enormous part of design and creation application.
Based on the standards and guidelines from [WCAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/), there are so many things you have to think about. In this part,
we are going to focus on how we can support our users from the developer side. Keep in mind - the major principle is still valid.
If you feel something is wrong with the UX/Web Accessibility. **SAY IT ALOUD**.
