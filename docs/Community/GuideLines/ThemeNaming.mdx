## Art of naming theme properties

You probably agree with the statement - the "hardest", and the most time-consuming part of programming is choosing a proper name for variables.
Let's talk about the idea, how to make theme consistent and easy to remember.

As you probably know BEM is not only for CSS it is much more complex. We can use it for folder structure,
data, naming variables, components, etc. Let's adapt [BEM methodology](https://en.bem.info/) into our theme principles.

#### What can be the BLOCK?

- main components: _avatar, badge, button, tabs, userStatus_
- internal components: _separator, icon, description_

#### What can be the ELEMENT?

- CSS properties: _padding, fontFamily, backgroundColor_

#### What can be the MODIFIER?

- States: _active, focus, hover, disabled, visited, error, warning_
- Sizing: _small, medium, large_
- Types: _primary, secondary_

**EXCEPTION FOR ELEMENTS**: _transition-timing-function, transition-duration_ it is too long, and much more easy to remember are in order: _transitionType, transitionTime_

### What do we support

- Colors,
- Offsets (padding, margins, offsets)
- Sizes
- Timing

### Elements

| Sizing    | Offset            | Text           | Color           | Border         | Animation / Transitions |
| --------- | ----------------- | -------------- | --------------- | -------------- | ----------------------- |
| size      | padding           | fontFamily     | color           | borderRadius   | transitionType          |
| height    | paddingHorizontal | fontStyle      | backgroundColor | borderColor    | transitionTime          |
| width     | paddingVertical   | fontWeight     | shadowSize      | borderWidth    | transitionDelay         |
| maxHeight | paddingTop        | fontSize       | shadowColor     | borderStyle    |                         |
| minHeight | paddingRight      | lineHeight     |                 | borderTopColor |                         |
| maxWidth  | paddingLeft       | textDecoration |                 | borderTopWidth |                         |
| minWidth  | paddingBottom     | letterSpacing  |                 | borderTopStyle |                         |
| scale     | margin            |                |                 |                |                         |
|           | marginHorizontal  |
|           | marginVertical    |
|           | marginTop         |
|           | marginRight       |
|           | marginLeft        |
|           | marginBottom      |
|           | offsetTop         |
|           | offsetRight       |
|           | offsetBottom      |
|           | offsetLeft        |

### States convention

- active
- focus
- hover
- disabled
- visited
- error
- warning

### Use case

| Block | Element     | Modifier | Modifier | Theme property              |
| ----- | ----------- | -------- | -------- | --------------------------- |
| tab   | Size        | Small    |          | tabSizeSmall                |
|       | BorderColor | Light    | Active   | tabBorderColorLightActive   |
|       |             |          | Disabled | tabBorderColorLightDisabled |
|       |             |          | Hover    | tabBorderColorLightHover    |

_Please notice the order of the modifiers is not a coincidence.
First is a modifier resulting from component API, the last one is referring to CSS states._

### Best practices for naming

- use property _background_ instead of _background-color_ (background allows to set up gradient),
- size is **ONLY** for components which are a **circle**, **square**. In general, for elements which have equal width, height,
- name of **BLOCK** should refer to the components name,

### Bad practices of naming

- Spacing,
- Offset,
- do NOT use TEXT as addition information: separatorTextColor => separatorColor,
- do NOT use accent color,
