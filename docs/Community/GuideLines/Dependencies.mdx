## Adding third party dependencies

Before you add dependency, ask yourself following questions:

- Review the internals, code quality, is it good enough?
- Is it actively maintained?
- How many issues are opened?
- Is someone actively working on it?
- Are bugs getting fixed?
- Are there any security problems?

### Which version to add

<hr />

It's a good practice to add the exact version to the `package.json`.
For example, instead of _^1.2.4_ add _1.2.4_. Updating should be done manually after reading the changelogs.

**Notice:**
We've had issues in the past when the next version was installed (a minor update) and things crashed out of nowhere.

### How to install (lodash use case)

<hr />

Adding a lodash dependencies it is desirable to add the exact functions that are being used instead of the whole lodash package.

```js
//package.json

// Bad
"lodash": "1.3.4"

// Good
"lodash.isUndefined": "1.2.3",
"lodash.isObject": "1.2.3"
```

```js
// MyComponent.js

//Bad
import { isUndefined, isObject } from 'lodash';

//Good
import isUndefined from 'lodash.isUndefined';
import isObject from 'lodash.isObject';
```

**Notice: lodash function packages can have different versions than lodash main package**
