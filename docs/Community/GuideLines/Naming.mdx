## Naming

Components should be named in a descriptive and straightforward way.

### General principles

<hr />

- Choose descriptive and unambiguous names
- Make meaningful distinction
- Use pronounceable names
- Use searchable names

### Extensions

<hr />

Apart from using JSX syntax in Oxygen, we use regular javascript extension of files .js

### Filename

<hr />

Use PascalCase for filenames. E.g., MyComponent.js

### Component naming

<hr />

Use the filename as the component name. For example, `MyComponent.js` should have a reference name of `MyComponent`.
However, for root components of a directory, use `index.js` as the filename and use the directory name as the component name:

```js
// Bad
import MyComponent from './MyComponent/MyComponent';

// Bad
import MyComponent from './MyComponent/index';

// The best
import MyComponent from './MyComponent';
```

**Be aware - In codebase, you can find different conventions. Do not hesitate and change it ðŸ’ª**
