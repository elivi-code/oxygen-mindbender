## Testing - Components

Below you can find the general guidelines:

- Mock dependencies,
- Add test case for each props,
- Be sensitive what you have in snapshot - for the first-time snapshots are generated always with success :),
- Auto-generate test coverage map, it is just a GUIDELINE, not an assurance,
- Be sensitive to warring in tests - missing a required props for instance,

### Run tests

<hr />

Tests are one of our points in the Definition of Done. We all do care and write test for our components.
To achieve that we use [Jest](https://jestjs.io/en/) and [Enzyme](https://airbnb.io/enzyme/)
which are recommended for React. UT Coverage should be give or take 100% if it is possible.

Tests should cover all cases in a component. You can usually hit 50% of coverage just by running a blank test.
The target is not that fancy percentage number but to properly implement a test suite.

```
$ yarn test
```

```
$ yarn test --watch
```

### Test coverage

The result of test coverage you can be found inside the `/coverage` folder by opening `index.html` in the browser.

```
$ yarn test --coverage
```
