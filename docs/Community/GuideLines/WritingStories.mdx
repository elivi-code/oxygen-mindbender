## Examples in StoryBook

[Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) is a UI development environment and playground for UI components.
The tool enables you to create components independently and showcase components interactively in an isolated development environment.

We want to transform typical storybook into complex platform which contains 8x8 Style Guide and core values.
According to that we decided to call stories just Examples. Below you can see what kind of structure we need at this moment:

- **Guidelines** - without any storybooks plugins. Have to be created based on our [Style Guide in Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/VRSpOSQhMekHut6COIGZTwNE/Global-Guidelines?node-id=968%3A0)
- **Playground** - with storybook plugins like: controls, info, actions, logger
- **Readme** - display information from README and CHANGELOG files

In that kind of structure we make happy both of ours user groups - marketing, designers and developers.

### File structure

<hr />

```
my-component-name
|---- examples
    |---- MyComponentName.guidelines.js
    |---- MyComponentName.playground.js
    |---- MyComponentName.readme.js
|---- dist
|---- src
CHANGELOG.md
README.md
package.json
```

### Naming convention

We standardized the naming convention for our stories, which helps us to find them quickly and be consistent.
The recommendation is to have:

```
01. Guidelines
02. Documentation
03. Changelog
10. Playground
```

If there are cases where multiple guidance pages are needed, the convention is to add a dash after the base name followed by something specific, example:

```
01. Guidelines - Classic
01. Guidelines - Novo
```

The playground is the place where we can write our examples that can be configured by using [controls](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/essentials/controls).
We can have multiple playground pages and the numbering starts from `10`. This allows us to have as many playgrounds as possible without influencing other pages.
Example:

```
10. Playground Avatar
11. Playground AvatarStack
```

### Example for MyComponentName.readme.js

<hr />

```js
import React from 'react';
import { Doc } from '@8x8/oxygen-storybook-utils';

import README from '../README.md?raw';
import CHANGELOG from '../CHANGELOG.md?raw';

export default {
  title: 'Components/MyComponent',
};

export const Documentation = () => (
  <Doc markdown>{README}</Doc>
);
Documentation.storyName = '02. Documentation';

export const Changelog = () => (
  <Doc markdown>{CHANGELOG}</Doc>
);
Changelog.storyName = '03. Changelog';
```
