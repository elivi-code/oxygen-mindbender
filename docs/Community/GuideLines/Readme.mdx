## Working with README

README should contain information about installation and instructions how to use the component. Think of it as a one-stop-shop for a component.
Once a developer reads it, he should be able to know what the component does, how it's installed and what the API looks like.

### Content:

<hr />

Every readme file should contain several sections to make it usable:

**1. Title**

**2. Installation**

A copy-and-paste CLI command to add the component to your project.

```
$ yarn add @8x8/oxygen-component
```

```
$ npm install @8x8/oxygen-component
```

**3.Usage**

A copy-and-paste component usage example as a code snippets ready to use.

```js
import Component from '@8x8/oxygen-component';

<Component title="Something" onClick={onComponentClick} />;
```

**Notice:**Depending on the complexity, you can write multiple examples for different use cases.

**4. Available styled-components**

Being able to customize the styling for a component it's usually necessary to override styles. All components should export their styled-components. Usually, it's just a list of the exported styled components names.

**5. API - Props table**

A table which contains the name, type, default value and short description of the component's props. If the prop is required, suffix the name with an asterisk.

| Name    | Type   | Default | Description       |
| ------- | ------ | ------- | ----------------- |
| color\* | string | blue    | Changes the color |

**6. Theme object**

List all the theme properties, as an object.

```js
button = {
  color: 'red',
};
```
