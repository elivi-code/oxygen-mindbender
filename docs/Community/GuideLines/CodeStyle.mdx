## Code style

Consistent and well-documented code is one of our core values.
According to that, we want to lint our code. In Oxygen there are two levels of the linting codebase:

### eslint

<hr />

Code style is based on [Airbnb React/JSX Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/react), with small portion of additional rules, which you can find in `.eslintrc` in [repository](https://git.8x8.com/platform/ui-components/oxygen)

### stylelint

<hr />

Details you can find in `.stylelintrc` in the <a href={REPOSITORY_URL} target="_blank">repository</a>

Consist JavaScript code style is provided by preconfigured eslint, stylelint and prettier. On every push, Jenkins pipeline runs linter.

**Good practices** is to run scripts just before push your code.

```
$ yarn lint
```

```
$ yarn test
```

Regardless of what kind of IDE you use, **we recommend installing extensions** for linters.
