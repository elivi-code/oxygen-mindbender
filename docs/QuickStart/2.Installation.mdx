## 1. Configure Oxygen

Below you can find a Step-by-Step Guide how to use Oxygen in your project:

**1.1 .npmrc file**

Create a `.npmrc` file in the same directory as `package.json` with following content:

```
// .npmrc
@8x8:registry=https://artifactory.es.8x8.com/artifactory/api/npm/npm-repository/
```

If you're using Nexus as registry for 8x8 scope, please read this blog post and update to Artifactory: https://oxygen.8x8.com/blog/say-hello-to-artifactory

**1.2 Install Config**

Install the `@8x8/oxygen-config` package using npm or yarn, depends on your needs

```ssh
yarn add @8x8/oxygen-config
```

```ssh
npm install @8x8/oxygen-config
```

Oxygen Config is a peer dependency for all Oxygen components. As a developer, make sure, the used Oxygen Config is compatible with all of your integrated components.

## 2. Add the font family

Oxygen components works amazing by default with _Inter_ font-family. The _Inter_ font assets are **not** automatically loaded by Oxygen.<br />
The classic theme of the Oxygen UI Components works with _Nunito_ font-family.<br />

The developer is responsible for loading all fonts used in their application, which is suitable for the chosen theme.

```html
<link
  href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:wght@100;200;300;400;500;600;700&display=swap"
  rel="stylesheet"
/>
```

```html
<link
  href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Nunito:400,600,700&amp;subset=latin-ext"
  rel="stylesheet"
/>
```

## 3. Install Components

Each component contains instructions on how to install and what props provide. Here you can see how to for e.g. `Button`:

```ssh
yarn add @8x8/oxygen-button
```

```ssh
npm install @8x8/oxygen-button
```
