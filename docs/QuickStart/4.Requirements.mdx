## Oxygen requirements

Oxygen library is based on [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) libraries.
In order to avoid multiple installations of these dependencies, they must be installed by the integrator.
Please consult the compatible peer dependency versions in components documentation.

**If you are new in the FrontEnd ecosystem you need to be familiar with:**

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#mac-stable)
