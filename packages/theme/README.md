# 8x8 Oxygen - Theme

This package holds theme definitions and color palettes.

## Usage

You _don't need to use this_. Instead make of of the `OxygenProvider` component, which exposes the theme object directly to your components.
Please look into `@8x8/oxygen-config` instead.

You can use the example pages to see the available colors and tokens.
